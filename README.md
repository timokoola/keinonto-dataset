# Keinonto Dataset

This repository contains a dataset of Finnish noun forms (`keinonto-dataset.tar.xgz`) specifically designed for studying and analyzing Finnish nominal morphology.

## Dataset Contents

The dataset includes Finnish noun forms with the following information for each entry:
- Word forms in different cases
- Declension category information
- Consonant gradation category information

## Data Format

The dataset is provided in a compressed tar.xz format (`keinonto-dataset.tar.xgz`). 

## Finnish Morphological Features

### Declension Categories
Finnish nouns are categorized into different declension patterns that determine how the stem changes when the word is inflected. These patterns are included in the dataset.

### Consonant Gradation
Consonant gradation is a common feature in Finnish morphology where consonants alternate between "strong" and "weak" grades depending on the word's position and form. The dataset includes information about which consonant gradation category each word belongs to.

## Usage

To use the dataset:
1. Download the `keinonto-dataset.tar.xgz` file
2. Extract using:
   ```bash
   tar -xf keinonto-dataset.tar.xgz
   ```
